# AVI Controller Deployment on GCP Terraform module
This Terraform module creates and configures an AVI (NSX Advanced Load-Balancer) Controller on AWS

## Module Functions
The module is meant to be modular and can create all or none of the prerequiste resources needed for the AVI AWS Deployment including:
* VPC and Subnets for the Controller and SEs (optional with create_networking variable)
* IAM Roles, Service Account, and Role Bindings (optional with create_iam variable)
* Security Groups for AVI Controller and SE communication
* AWS EC2 Instance using an official AVI AMI
* High Availability AVI Controller Deployment (optional with controller_ha variable)

During the creation of the Controller instance the following initialization steps are performed:
* Copy Ansible playbook to controller using the assigned public IP
* Run Ansible playbook to configure initial settings and AWS Full Access Cloud 


## Usage
This is an example of a controller deployment that leverages an existing VPC (with a cidr_block of 10.154.0.0/16) and 3 subnets. The public key is already created in EC2 and the private key found in the "/home/<user>/.ssh/id_rsa" will be used to copy and run the Ansible playbook to configure the Controller.
```hcl
module "avi_controller" {
  version = "1.0.0"

  region = "us-west-1"
  create_networking = "false"
  create_iam = "false"
  controller_version = "20.1.3"
  custom_vpc_id = "vpc-<id>"
  custom_subnet_ids = ["subnet-<id>","subnet-<id>","subnet-<id>"]
  avi_cidr_block = "10.154.0.0/16"
  controller_image_gs_path = "<bucket>/gcp_controller-20.1.3-9085.tar.gz"
  controller_password = "<newpassword>"
  key_pair_name = "<key>"
  private_key_path = "/home/<user>/.ssh/id_rsa"
  name_prefix = "<name>"
  custom_tags = { "Department": "IT", "Function": "Loadbalancing"}
}

```
